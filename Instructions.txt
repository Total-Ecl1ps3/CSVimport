See example.csv for csv formatting!

To run the program, you will need to enable unsigned powershell-scripts to run on your server, to do this type:
'Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted' And press 'Y' to accept. When the program is finished we can re-enable the security protocol with:
'Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted' And press 'Y' to accept.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For full version:
The script needs a "D" drive on the server, with a folder named "Users" on the drive. (D:\Users)
The "Users" folder needs to be shared with the group "Domain Users", read access is suitable.

For lite version:
The Lite version does not create home folders, therefore a "D:\Users" folder is not required.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Move the program (CSVImport.ps1) to any directory you want, and move the .csv file you want to import into the same directory.
Right click the .ps1 file and select 'Run with PowerShell'. If there is a warning select 'Open'. (Or use PowerShell to cd to the directory, write '.\CSVImport.ps1' and press 'R' then 'Enter' to run the program.
Fill out the fields given to you, end with 'Enter'
  Server name: 'Name of the server you're importing the users into. ie. "Server-DC1"
  Password: The single use password that the users will have to change on first login.
  Full domain name: The full domain name, ie. 'testdomain.com'
  CSV file name: The name of the file you want to import, ie. For the file 'Employees2017.csv' you want to write 'Employees2017.csv' and press 'Enter'
The program will now attempt to create the users in AD, and a home folder for each user in D:\Users (ie. 'D:\Users\tom.michaels')
If there is a folder called 'Everyone' the program will not touch this, however if there is not a folder named 'Everyone' in the Users directory, one will be made and write access will be granted for all domain users.
