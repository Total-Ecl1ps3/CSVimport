# CSVimport V1.1
Tool to easily import users into AD from a CSV file

### Lite VS Regular version
Lite version does not create home folders. The regular version (CSVimport.ps1) will create home folders in "D:\Users", and therefore requires a "D:\" drive with a "D:\Users" folder, shared with read access to domain users.
